# Sorting Visualizer
A Sorting Visualizer Application implemented by simple html, css & javascript.

It visualizes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort & Merge Sort, through respective asyncronous functions which take an Array of DOM element objects as a parameter & sorts the elements in-place, in ascending order using some custom documented APIs for visualization. For color-code, please kindly refer to the respective-sort.js file in scripts folder. The deployment of the project has been done through [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
